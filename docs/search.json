This can occur when “null” values are represented in some non-standard way. For instance, in these files, we see that missing values are represented as \\\\N. R does not know that these are NA values and so retains them as strings.\nTo fix this, we need to use:\n\nthe mutate command, since we’re changing the type of a column\nthe as.numeric command to change the type of the column.\n\n\n\nCode\n## Task 1 - Column Type Correction\nTITLE_BASICS &lt;- TITLE_BASICS %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    startYear = as.numeric(startYear),\n    endYear = as.numeric(endYear),\n    isAdult = as.logical(isAdult)\n  )\n\n\nWarning: There were 2 warnings in `mutate()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `startYear = as.numeric(startYear)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

The phrase comes from a controversial fifth season episode (aired in 1977) in which a lead character literally jumped over a shark on water skis. Idiomatically, it is used to refer to the moment when a once-great show becomes ridiculous and rapidly looses quality.\nIs it true that episodes from later seasons of Happy Days have lower average ratings than the early seasons?\nEarly Season Episodes Average rating : 7.46\nLater Season Episodes Average rating : 6.81\n\n\nCode\n# Check if there are any *Happy Days* episodes in the data\nhappy_days_titles &lt;- TITLE_BASICS %&gt;%\n  filter(primaryTitle == \"Happy Days\", titleType == \"tvEpisode\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of Happy Days titles\nhead(happy_days_titles)\n\n\n[1] tconst         titleType      primaryTitle   originalTitle  isAdult       \n[6] startYear      endYear        runtimeMinutes genres        \n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\nCode\n# Check the number of rows\nnrow(happy_days_titles)\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nCode\n## There are multiple entries, including movies, a TV series, and shorts, but the main Happy Days TV series seems to be listed under tconst = tt0070992 (with start year 1974 and end year 1984).\n\n# Find episodes for the Happy Days TV series (tt0070992)\nhappy_days_episodes &lt;- TITLE_EPISODES %&gt;%\n  filter(parentTconst == \"tt0070992\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of episodes\nhead(happy_days_episodes)\n\n\n     tconst parentTconst seasonNumber episodeNumber\n1 tt0596133    tt0070992            3            10\n2 tt0596134    tt0070992           10             5\n3 tt0596135    tt0070992            4             4\n4 tt0596137    tt0070992            4             7\n5 tt0596139    tt0070992            4            15\n6 tt0596140    tt0070992            3            23\n\n\nCode\n# Join with TITLE_RATINGS to get ratings for Happy Days episodes\nhappy_days_ratings &lt;- happy_days_episodes %&gt;%\n  inner_join(TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\")\n\n# Display the first few rows of episodes with ratings\nhead(happy_days_ratings)\n\n\n     tconst parentTconst seasonNumber episodeNumber averageRating numVotes\n1 tt0596133    tt0070992            3            10           8.4      175\n2 tt0596134    tt0070992           10             5           6.7      114\n3 tt0596135    tt0070992            4             4           7.9      126\n4 tt0596137    tt0070992            4             7           8.1      129\n5 tt0596139    tt0070992            4            15           7.9      127\n6 tt0596140    tt0070992            3            23           7.9      137\n\n\nCode\n# Compare average ratings for early (seasons 1-5) and late seasons (6+)\nearly_seasons &lt;- happy_days_ratings %&gt;%\n  filter(seasonNumber &lt;= 5) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_rating = mean(averageRating, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nlate_seasons &lt;- happy_days_ratings %&gt;%\n  filter(seasonNumber &gt; 5) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_rating = mean(averageRating, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# Display the comparison\nearly_seasons\n\n\n  avg_rating\n1   7.460345\n\n\nCode\nlate_seasons\n\n\n  avg_rating\n1   6.809524"

Documentaries have been increasingly successful in recent decades. 1990s: Drama and Comedy were dominant genres, and this pattern continues into the 2000s. 1980s and earlier: The most successful genres were more evenly spread, but Drama and Action were consistently significant.\n\n\nCode\nTITLE_BASICS &lt;- TITLE_BASICS %&gt;%\n  mutate(decade = floor(startYear / 10) * 10)  # Group years by decades\n\nmovies_with_ratings &lt;- TITLE_BASICS %&gt;%\n  inner_join(TITLE_RATINGS, by = \"tconst\") %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(averageRating) & !is.na(genres) & !is.na(decade))  # Ensure no missing values\n\nmovies_with_ratings &lt;- movies_with_ratings %&gt;%\n  separate_rows(genres, sep = \",\")\n\nsuccess_threshold &lt;- 8.0\n\nsuccess_by_genre_decade &lt;- movies_with_ratings %&gt;%\n  filter(success_metric &gt; success_threshold) %&gt;%\n  group_by(genres, decade) %&gt;%\n  summarise(success_count = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(success_count))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'genres'.

What genre used to reliably produced “successes” and has fallen out of favor?\nDocumentaries have seen a sharp rise, particularly after 2000. This could indicate growing interest in non-fiction storytelling in the last two decades. Animation (yellow) and Sci-Fi (purple) have had significant success post-2000, showing a growing trend in family-oriented and futuristic content.\nWhat genre has produced the most “successes” since 2010? Does it have the highest success rate or does it only have a large number of successes because there are many productions in that genre?\nMusicals (pink) and Western (light yellow) had much more success in the early 1900s and mid-century but have since declined dramatically, almost disappearing by the 2000s. Film-Noir (dark gray) and History (gray) were more successful earlier in cinema history but have diminished in modern decades.\nWhat genre has become more popular in recent years?\nDocumentaries dominate in the 2010s, followed by Drama, Comedy, and Action, showing a continued focus on both factual and dramatic storytelling."

With a remarkable IMDb rating of 9.3, the series has captured the hearts of generations with its calming, instructive approach to painting. The show’s philosophy of “happy little trees” and Bob Ross’s soothing voice made it a favorite for art lovers and general audiences alike. However, this series has not been remade or revisited in the last 25 years, making it an ideal candidate for a modern remake.\nRemake Concept: This remake could take the form of a documentary that not only pays tribute to the original Joy of Painting but also explores Bob Ross’s lasting cultural impact. The film could dive into the rise of “Bob Ross” as a phenomenon, his philosophy of art and life, and how his gentle approach continues to inspire new artists. Additionally, we could explore the lesser-known aspects of his personal life and artistic journey.\nPotential Fan Service: While Bob Ross passed away in 1995, his legacy has been preserved by the Bob Ross Inc. company. By involving people who worked closely with him during the original show, such as his son Steve Ross (who occasionally appeared on the original series), we could add a heartfelt, nostalgic element for longtime fans. Moreover, utilizing original footage from the show, remastered in higher quality, can further connect the new documentary to the beloved original series.\nKey Talent:\n\nJonathan Aris (Actor/Narrator): His soothing, authoritative voice would be perfect for narrating the life and philosophy of Bob Ross.\nPeter Thomas (Narrator): A veteran narrator with experience in documentaries, he can bring gravitas and warmth to the documentary.\nJames H. White (Director): With his extensive experience in documentary filmmaking, James H. White can guide the film, blending modern storytelling with classic archival footage to create a compelling narrative.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nConfirming Rights: Since Bob Ross’s image and legacy are controlled by Bob Ross Inc., we will need to ensure that the legal rights to use his name and likeness are secured.\nEngaging Original Cast/Contributors: Reach out to key people who worked with Bob Ross, like his son Steve Ross, to participate in the documentary.\n\nRemaking The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross as a modern documentary will not only cater to the nostalgic audience but will also introduce a new generation to the calming, creative magic of Bob Ross. With the right talent and storytelling approach, this project has the potential to be both a critical and commercial success."

    "text": "Task 7 - Write and Deliver Your Pitch\nNow that you have completed your analysis, write an “elevator pitch” of approximately 200-250 words for your proposed Hollywood project. This is the pitch you will bring to the studio head (your boss); if the studio head likes your pitch, you will be given a small sum of money to start securing the story rights and locking down tentative deals with key talent.\nYour pitch needs to synthesize the analysis above into two to three quick and compelling points. (E.g., “The market for animated young adult horror musicals has grown 200% in the past decade” or “Over 90% of Director D’s movies are successes.”) You need to present the strongest argument for each element of your pitch, including genre, director, actors, and story.\nIf your boss approves the pitch, you will need to have a brief trailer ready for the next quarterly earnings call. The marketing department has asked that you prepare a classic 90’s style teaser for them.\nIn the world of art and relaxation, few figures have achieved the cult status of Bob Ross. His iconic series, The Joy of Painting, has captivated audiences since its debut in 1983, earning a staggering 9.3 IMDb rating. With today’s resurgence of nostalgia and the rising trend of soothing, feel-good content, now is the perfect time to introduce The Joy of Painting to a new generation through a modern documentary.\n\nOur project will focus on exploring the cultural phenomenon of Bob Ross—how his gentle, positive approach to art continues to inspire millions even decades after his passing. This documentary will include never-before-seen remastered footage from the original series, along with insights from his son Steve Ross, bringing both nostalgia and fresh perspectives.\n\nWe’ve assembled top talent for this film: Jonathan Aris, whose calm and authoritative narration will complement the meditative tone of the project, and James H. White, a director with a proven track record of producing successful documentaries. With Bob Ross’s signature “happy little trees” at its core, this film is guaranteed to attract fans old and new.\n\nThis documentary, which blends inspiration, art, and tranquility, has the potential to become the next big success in the world of feel-good content. Let’s bring Bob Ross’s timeless message of positivity back to the forefront, with a modern twist.\n\n“From James H. White, the visionary mind behind Connections, and Jonathan Aris, the beloved star of Good Omens, comes the timeless tale of ‘Bob Ross. A story of art, peace, and happy little trees.’ Coming soon to a theater near you.”"
